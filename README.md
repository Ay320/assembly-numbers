# x86 Assembly Language Project

This simple project demonstrates the use of Intel x86 assembly language embedded within a C program. 
The purpose of this program is to prompt the user to enter a specified number of integers and then summarize the count of positive, negative, and zero integers entered.

## Project Overview

The program performs the following tasks:
- Asks the user how many numbers they would like to enter.
- Loops for the given number of times, prompting the user to input a number each time.
- Utilizes assembly code to classify the numbers as positive, negative, or zero.
- Displays a summary of how many positive, negative, and zero numbers were entered.
